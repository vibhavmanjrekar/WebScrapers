# Web Scrapers

This is a collection of web scrapers of different complexities. Currently, this repo contains two scrapers: a simple python3 scraper that finds results from Yelp and stores it to a variable that is printed for easier visibility and debugging, and a bs4/python3 sraper that scrapes the first sandbox on ScrapeThisSite diving into html tags.
